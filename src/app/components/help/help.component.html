			<p>The checklist tool is made up of three main parts:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Content selection</li>
				<li>Compliance level selection</li>
				<li>The guidelines to test</li>
			</ul>

			<p>At any point you can move backwards to any particular stage of the tool by selecting that step from the 3-step
				navigation at the very top of the tool.</p>

			<p><a href="#contents-section">Back to top</a></p>

			<section id="content-selection" aria-labelledby="content-selection-heading">
				<h3 id="content-selection-heading">Content Selection</h3>

				<p>The content selection screen is where you try to best match the content types you wish to check. Here's a
					better breakdown of what each type covers:</p>

				<dl>
					<dt>Animation</dt>
					<dd>This covers everything from a full-on animated show piece right, a website with animations as a user
						scrolls, right the way through to a website using subtle pulsing animation to draw attention to new
						features.</dd>

					<dt>Audio</dt>
					<dd>Any website that uses audio, including noises attached to events (messages, alerts, etc) and the adio
						from videos.</dd>

					<dt>Forms</dt>
					<dd>Forms are a crucial part of the web, and this covers all the things you need to check if your content
						contains them or form components, like buttons, text inputs, checkboxes, and other form-like components.</dd>

					<dt>Images</dt>
					<dd>This covers tradition <code>&lt;img></code> images as well as <code>&lt;canvas></code> and
						<code>&lt;svg></code>. Even CSS images would be covered under this.</dd>

					<dt>Modals</dt>
					<dd>Modals include things like alerts, prompts, and confirmation dialogs which attempt to trap the user in
						them until a specific type of action is taken. A regular system modal dialog handles many of the normal
						accessibility needs of a user, but they often get re-implemented to allow for better customisation.</dd>

					<dt>Timed</dt>
					<dd>If components on your website require a user to be able to take a specific action in a specific timeframe,
						then this will ensure the generated guidelines cover it. For example, things like drop-down (not
						<code>&lt;select></code>) menus which require a mouse movement from point a to b in less than a second
						would count under this.</dd>

					<dt>Translations</dt>
					<dd>Any content which is available in either multiple languages, or content which includes mixed language
						content needs some specific language guideline checks.</dd>

					<dt>Video</dt>
					<dd>As well as traditional video content, this also covers things like animations which are video-like.</dd>
				</dl>

				<p>If your content includes none of these types, then only a few accessibility guidelines which apply to all
					basic content will be presented.</p>

			<section id="compliance-level-selection" aria-labelledby="compliance-level-selection-heading">
				<h3 id="compliance-level-selection-heading">Compliance level selection</h3>

				<p>Compliance against the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) ranges from the most basic (A) up to
					the near impossible (AAA). It's fairly typical to aim for AA compliance, as it's a good middle ground.</p>
				<p>AAA compliance is incredibly difficult to achieve, especially if you have live video content. On the other
					hand, single-A compliance is very easy, but doesn't generate a very big change for those most in need.</p>

			<section id="guidelines-to-test" aria-labelledby="guidelines-to-test-heading">
				<h3 id="guidelines-to-test-heading">The Guidelines to Test</h3>

				<p>Once you've made your selections, you'll be presented with a selection of guidelines which best match your
					choices from the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/">WCAG 2.1</a> specification.</p>

				<p>Each guideline is listed under its main groups (perceivable, operable, understandable, & robust), which
					generally outline what type of thing they check.</p>

				<p>Initially, all guidelines are in their minimised state, with only their checkbox, number, and name shown.
					Each one can be expanded by clicking on the name to show a more detailed description that explains the
					guideline better. Where possible, there are code snippets which you can copy and paste into your browser
					console to test the live content of your website. These snippets range from testing images without alternative
					text, to the colour contrast of text elements on the page.</p>

			<h2 id="saving-loading-heading">Saving/Loading</h2>

			<p>You can save and load a single state using the buttons provided in the toolbar. This functionality has been built
				with privacy in mind, so state is saved in your browsers local storage rather than in a cookie or directly against
				a server.</p>

			<p><a href="#contents-section">Back to top</a></p>

			<section id="saving-section" aria-labelledby="saving-section-heading">
				<h3 id="saving-section-heading">Saving</h3>

				<p>If you have no current saved state, then clicking the save button will do so with only a success notification.
					However, if you already have a state saved, you will be warned about overwriting this if you continue.</p>

				<p><a href="#contents-section">Back to top</a></p>
			</section>

			<section id="loading-section" aria-labelledby="loading-section-heading">
				<h3 id="loading-section-heading">Loading</h3>

				<p>Clicking the load button will always ask for confirmation about loading a state over the current state. This
					is to ensure that you don't accidentally load a state over the top of any current changes or selections you
					may have made.</p>
